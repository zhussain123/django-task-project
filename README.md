# Django Task Project

This project is a **Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)** based application that demonstrates how to fetch and serve complex SQL data through clean ORM queries and REST APIs.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project connects multiple related database tables ‚Äî such as `Company`, `Company_Executives`, `Persons`, and `LinkedIn_Person` ‚Äî and exposes structured data using Django REST API endpoints.

It includes **five queries** (SQL + ORM) implemented in **views** and **utils**, each fetching specific business information.
